# Breast_cancer_Classification
This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using features extracted from mammograms. The project implements various machine learning algorithms including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression.
# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on classifying breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using features extracted from mammograms.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning techniques can assist in automating the classification of breast cancer tumors based on various features extracted from medical images.

This project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for the classification of breast cancer tumors using a publicly available dataset. The models implemented include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from digitized images of breast cancer tumors, including radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension.
